      <p><strong>Major and Year of Study:</strong> Computer Science, 2nd year</p>
      <p><strong>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills? If you've never done anything related to web development, that's fine, but make sure to say that here.</strong> My freshman year of highschool I designed a camping related website using a lot of CSS to make it super clean looking and professional.</p>
      <p><strong>What do you hope to learn from this class?</strong> I hope to relearn the skills I did freshman year and more in hopes of being able to use my skills in the professional world.</p>
      <p><strong>Have you signed up for our course Ed forum?</strong> Yes.</p>
      <p><strong>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had. There's no need to wrack your brain about this: include only what you can think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.</strong> In the summer of 2021, I went on a 40 mile backpacking trip that taught me many lessons about not taking things for granted. It was a difficult trek, including one 16 mile incline day, but it was worth it for the immaculate views and great memories.<p>
